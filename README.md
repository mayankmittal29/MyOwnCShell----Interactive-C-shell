Introduction

This document describes the implementation and usage of a custom shell with various features such as system calls, file handling, process management, and networking.
Basic System Calls
Display Requirement

The shell prompt displays in the form <Username@SystemName:~>. The username and system name are dynamically retrieved, and the current directory is shown relative to the shell's home directory (~).
Input Requirements

    The shell supports a list of commands separated by ; or &.
    Commands can be executed in the background with &.
    Multiple commands can be given using ;.
    Commands with errors will display an error message.

warp Command

The warp command changes the current working directory.

    Supports . (current directory), .. (parent directory), ~ (home directory), and - (previous directory).
    Executes sequentially if multiple arguments are provided.
    Prints the full path after changing the directory.

peek Command

The peek command lists files and directories.

    Default behavior excludes hidden files.
    Flags:
        -l: Displays extra information.
        -a: Includes hidden files.
    Supports symbols like ., .., ~, and -.

pastevents Command

The pastevents command is similar to the history command in Bash.

    Stores the 15 most recent commands.
    Commands identical to the previous one are not stored.
    Persistent over different shell runs.
    Subcommands:
        pastevents: Displays the history.
        pastevents purge: Clears the history.
        pastevents execute <index>: Executes a command from the history.

System Commands

    Executes other system commands present in Bash (e.g., emacs, gedit).
    Supports both foreground and background processes.
    Prints the time taken for processes running more than 2 seconds.

proclore Command

The proclore command displays process information.

    Displays:
        PID
        Process status (R/R+/S/S+/Z)
        Process group
        Virtual memory
        Executable path

seek Command

The seek command searches for files or directories.

    Flags:
        -d: Only look for directories.
        -f: Only look for files.
        -e: Prints content or changes the directory if only one match is found.
    Supports symbols like ., .., ~, and -.
    Prints "No match found!" if no match is found.
    Prints "Invalid flags!" if both -d and -f are used simultaneously.

Processes, Files, and Misc.
I/O Redirection

    Supports >, >>, and <.
    Creates or appends to files as necessary.
    Displays "No such input file found!" if the input file does not exist.

Pipes

    Supports piping between commands.
    Executes commands sequentially from left to right.
    Displays "Invalid use of pipe" if improperly used.

Redirection along with Pipes

    Supports I/O redirection with pipes.
    Ensures proper functionality when used together.

activities Command

The activities command lists all running processes spawned by the shell.

    Displays:
        Command name
        PID
        State (Running or Stopped)

Signals

    ping <pid> <signal_number>: Sends a signal to a process.
    Handles special keyboard inputs:
        Ctrl-C: Sends SIGINT to foreground process.
        Ctrl-D: Logs out of the shell.
        Ctrl-Z: Stops the foreground process.

fg and bg Commands

    fg <pid>: Brings a background process to the foreground.
    bg <pid>: Changes the state of a stopped background process to running.

neonate Command

    neonate -n [time_arg]: Prints the PID of the most recently created process every [time_arg] seconds until x is pressed.

Networking
iMan Command

    iMan <command_name>: Fetches and displays the man page for a given command from the internet.
